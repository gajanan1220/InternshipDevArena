⭐ Step-by-step understanding
1️⃣ Python reads the file from top to bottom

It starts from the first line.

2️⃣ It runs each line one by one

Like a person following instructions.

3️⃣ Variables are created

name = "Gajanan" → stored in memory.

4️⃣ Python performs operations

result = a + b → adds 10 + 5.

5️⃣ Python prints output on screen

That’s what print() does.
